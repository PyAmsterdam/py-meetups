We need a better testing framework
==================================

Abstract
--------

Python has a super rich and active ecosystem, and `py.test` is great, but I
believe we deserve a better testing framework. This is why I've started
developing a new framework named "Nimoy". Using Nimoy, I set out to make Python
testing beautiful, expressive, pragmatic and fun.
