Using micropython in IOT applications
=====================================

by 'Marc Wagner <marcwagner>'_

[Marc Wagner](https://github.com/marcwagner) is a passionate maker and amateur python developer. While attempting to create a sunrise alarm clock he stumbled uppon micropython and hasn't looked back since. Now he has at least 10 lights and sensors in his home running off an esp8266 and micropython and that collection is nly growing.

Abstract
--------
Micropython is a python implementation for microcontrollers and other low-level hardware. It implements a subset of the python language and adds some hardware specific modules. This talk aims to give an overview and a demo of micropython. We will cover the following topics

1) brief history
2) Cpython <> micropython
3) Why use micropython (instead of arduino/C++)
4) Some cool features: machine, async, mqtt & more
5) practical example: blinking lights and a button
