by `Jan Gazda`_

What can we learn from PyconCZ and Czech python community?

Abstract
--------

Every year I visit my home country to attend `PyconCZ`_ and meet with my PyFriends.
There are always interesting topics but few stand out and I'd like to share those with you.
I will also to give you a closer look at how we organize our community
in Czech Republic and how this could help our Amsterdam community.
