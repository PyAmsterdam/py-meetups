Abstract
--------
At Picnic, decisions are always backed by data. Coming from a variety of systems, this data is then crunched with the help of Python and SQL. We will walk you through our journey of building the ultimate source of truth, the Data Warehouse, and how Python has helped us create a Data Vault capture framework, applying strong Software Engineering principles to ensure our pipelines are always robust and maintainable.
