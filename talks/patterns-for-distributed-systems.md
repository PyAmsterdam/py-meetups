Practical patterns in distributed systems for mere mortals (aka. patterns for microservices)
- 
This is an introductory talk for some practical patterns that can be used in a distributed service architectures

Such as 
- Queues/workflows/routing slips
- Audit logs
- Event driven architecture
- Change-Data-Capture
- Event sourcing
- CQRS
- Distributed locks
- Sagas

And will try to explain, ways to deal with eventual consistency, race conditions in distributed systems.

Patterns are basic building blocks for any system. Usually when people talk about patterns, 
they treat them as sacred, unalterable, invariable, permanent things. Although they definetly evolve,
you can interpret them in many different ways, or you can just use some parts of a pattern,
skipping all the dogma surrounding them. 

The aim for this talk is to give an overview of some patterns that can be used in pragmatic, practical way with examples using python - and without all the glorified language around them.
