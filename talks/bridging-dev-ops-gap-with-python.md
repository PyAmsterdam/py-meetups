## Abstract
The goal of this talk is to show how Python is used within Bestseller E-commerce to help developers use and manage the infrastructure for their applications.

It does so through a couple of "war stories" about tools and practices used today in one of the biggest fashion web shops in Europe. The talk covers four "war stories": 

* handling credentials in version control using `Ansible` plugins
* detailed monitoring of a Kafka cluster with `Datadog`
* ensuring infrastructure compliance with `AWS Config`
* ensuring ~~everything~~ most things ~~is~~ are tagged with `AWS Lambda`
