Practical patterns in distributed systems
=========================================

Practical patterns in distributed systems for mere mortals, aka. patterns for microservices
By `Aybars Badour <_ybrs>`_

Abstract
--------

This is an introductory talk for some practical patterns that can be used in a distributed service architectures, such as
- Queues/workflows/routing slips
- Audit logs
- Event driven architecture
- Change-Data-Capture
- Event sourcing
- CQRS
- Distributed locks
- Sagas

I will try to explain ways to deal with eventual consistency, race conditions in distributed systems.

Patterns are basic building blocks for any system. Usually when people talk about patterns,
they treat them as sacred, unalterable, invariable, permanent things. Although they definetly evolve,
you can interpret them in many different ways, or you can just use some parts of a pattern,
skipping all the dogma surrounding them.

PyconCZ 2019
============

by `Jan Gazda`_

What can we learn from PyconCZ and Czech python community?

Abstract
--------

Every year I visit my home country to attend `PyconCZ`_ and meet with my PyFriends.
There are always interesting topics but few stand out and I'd like to share those with you.
I will also to give you a closer look at how we organize our community
in Czech Republic and how this could help our Amsterdam community.
