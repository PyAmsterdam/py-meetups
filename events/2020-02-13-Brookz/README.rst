Python in digital humanities research
-------------------------------------

About `Cornelis van Lit`_:
Dr. Cornelis van Lit is a postdoctoral researcher at Utrecht University.
His main expertise lies in Islamic philosophy, which is what his first book is about,
entitled The World of Image in Islamic Philosophy (Edinburgh University Press, 2017).
He recently wrote Among Digitized Manuscripts published by Brill in hardback and electronic open access.
It is a handbook introducing a conceptual and practical toolbox for working with digital photos of text materials,
starting with the very basics assuming no prior computer skills and ending
with explaining automated image analysis using Python and OpenCV.
For more information see www.lwcvl.com/Among Van Lit has been working to introduce computer-supported
solutions into Islamic studies for a number of years through his online magazine The Digital Orientalist,
which now has a team of eight editors. He currently aims to return in his research to medieval philosophy,
investigating the discussions of Ibn Arabi (d. 1231) and his commentators on the imagination.
He is also a friar of the Order of Preachers.

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

How did a monk who studies ancient texts saved in medieval manuscripts end up using Python in his work?
The short answer is: technology has become too easy to pass up on the opportunity. As it turns out,
to get meaningful results, even for advanced Humanities research, you do not need to work in a CS department.
I will start off by giving four examples. First I use Python with
OpenCV to identify the physical shape of a manuscript.
I explain how I ran this over thousands of manuscripts,
extracting information relevant for understanding premodern book making.
Then I discuss my inroads in layout analysis, resulting in what is akin to an x-ray of a manuscript.
In both examples I will point out how OpenCV was not built for this,
but is performant enough to do the job even on our personal machines.
We then switch to a different use case: creating a timeline showing which points in time
a certain topic was very popular to discuss (specifically, the topic is the Hadith collection of al-Bukhari).
I close with a project I am currently working on:
creating a rudimentary OCR pipeline for modern Arabic printed materials.
I will finish with a brief explanation of the difficulty of navigating the two worlds:
the digital world of developers and the paper world of the Humanities and give some pointers
how you as developers could be part of this discussion.
