Python 2 vs. Python 3: How to Navigate the Change
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Python 2.7 has 9 candles on its birthday cake and the maintainers are committed to dropping support within a year. We are all familiar with the technical implications of the change, so why are we running production code on almost unsupported platform? What is preventing teams and companies to pull the plug from Python 2? In this talk we will show how we got moving with the migration, examples of small and large projects and what challenges still lie ahead. We hope to start an open discussion about this topic at the end of the talk.
