Hi everyone!

Welcome
=========

We are pleased to invite you for the first round of PyAmsterdam meetup.
The event will take place on Wednesday 13th of February, at the Optiver office.

We will start with some delicious pizza and beer. After a short intro about the ideas of the new meetup we move directly to the talks. First Mikaeil Orfanian will talk about ‘Architecture for Everyday Programming’. After a break, Optiver’s Joost Lek will take you on a journey towards Python 3 future. We will continue Python 3 discussions over beer until the closing time.

Talk 1
======

Architecture for Everyday Programming
-------------------------------------------------------

What classes and abstractions do I need? Does this block of code belong to this class or do I need to make a new one? How will different objects, modules, and packages work together? What parts of my app should be covered by automated tests? What should the scope of each unit test be? What is the role of integration tests? In the last few years a wave of new models (e.g. Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, Boundaries) have appeared that try to answer these questions. In this talk we will discuss a more lightweight set of guidelines that are designed to be easy to understand and follow. This talk is for you if your work on applications that are made up of more than a 100 lines of code.

Talk 2
======

Python 2 vs. Python 3: How to Navigate the Change
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Python 2.7 has 9 candles on its birthday cake and the maintainers are committed to dropping support within a year. We are all familiar with the technical implications of the change, so why are we running production code on almost unsupported platform? What is preventing teams and companies to pull the plug from Python 2? In this talk we will show how we got moving with the migration, examples of small and large projects and what challenges still lie ahead. We hope to start an open discussion about this topic at the end of the talk.

Note about the speaker : Joost Lek works on automating the trading environment using Python and leads the Options Automation Team at Optiver.
