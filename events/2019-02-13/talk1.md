Architecture for Everyday Programming
-------------------------------------------------------

What classes and abstractions do I need? Does this block of code belong to this class or do I need to make a new one? How will different objects, modules, and packages work together? What parts of my app should be covered by automated tests? What should the scope of each unit test be? What is the role of integration tests? In the last few years a wave of new models (e.g. Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, Boundaries) have appeared that try to answer these questions. In this talk we will discuss a more lightweight set of guidelines that are designed to be easy to understand and follow. This talk is for you if your work on applications that are made up of more than a 100 lines of code.
