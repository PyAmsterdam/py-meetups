==============================================

Are you dealing with isolation due to COVID-19? Are you missing your friends from the Python community?
PyAmsterdam is also moving online to help you!
This is going to be our first online meetup and we have two SUPER AWESOME speakers!!

# FIXME: add img with speakers pictures and pyamsterdam + sponsor logo #

Did learn about something cool, want to share what you have created  or
simply share the struggle with your current project?
NOW is the time!
We would like to include some lightning talks (5min talk) to this event.
You do not need any slides or laptop (though it helps). Just sing up at the event!

How to be Pythonic? Design a Query Language in Python  
-----------------------------------------------------

We created Python API calls that let you can make queries and manipulate data in our graph database. We thought about what will be best for Pythonistas? What will be the most Pythonic way to do it? (Is it a thing?) Hereâ€™s our journey in making WOQLpy and we want to make it useful to you.

After having a career in data science, Cheuk now brings her knowledge in data and passion for the tech community into TerminusDB as the developer relations lead. Cheuk constantly contributes to the open-source community by giving AI and deep learning workshops and organize sprints to encourage diversity contributions.
