Welcome again!
================

We are happy to announce the second instance of the PyAmsterdam meetup. This event will be kindly hosted by Crunchr. This time we  want to make space for 3 talks. Beers and pizza of course provided.

We are still looking for interesting proposals to try our voting system:

The space will be somewhat limited so we will open the registration 4 weeks before the meetup.
